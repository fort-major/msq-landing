                                but as a wallet designed for your daily needs.

                                is meant to be your go-to for <b>"crypto pocket money"</b>. It's built to simplify spending 
                                without compromising on security. We believe that by making transactions more straightforward, 
                                rather than focusing solely on investment, we can help propel cryptocurrency towards global adoption.

                                Many features of MSQ Snap are available at no cost. However, when you make online purchases using 
                                MSQ as your payment method, we apply a modest service fee of <span class="btn">1%</span>. This fee is specific to the payment 
                                process. For other transactions, like sending money to someone, there are no additional MSQ fees â€” you 
                                only cover the standard network fee.

                                Depositing funds into your MSQ wallet can be done in various ways. For instance, if you have funds in 
                                your <a target="_blank" href="https://nns.ic0.app">NNS wallet</a>, you can transfer some to your MSQ wallet by sending them to the unique principal ID 
                                of your MSQ account. To find this principal ID, click on the <span class="btn">Receive</span> button in 
                                your MSQ account and then use the <span class="btn">Copy</span> button to copy it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Itâ€™s important to note that MSQ operates differently from many wallets: each account has a unique 
                                <span class="btn">principal ID</span> <b>for each type of token</b>. This means you must use the 
                                correct <span class="btn">principal ID</span> for each specific token type â€” your ICP 
                                accountâ€™s <span class="btn">principal ID</span> won't work for receiving CHAT, for example.

                                Sending funds with MSQ is straightforward. First, go to the account from which you want to send money and click 
                                the <span class="btn">Send</span> button. Then, enter the recipientâ€™s account details, click continue, and confirm 
                                the transaction in MetaMask.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Please be cautious and double-check the recipient's information before confirming the transaction. Keep in mind that 
                                we are unable to recover your funds if a mistake is made during the transfer process.

                            <p>There are two methods to receive funds: the traditional way and the simplified way.</p>
                            <p>
                                <b>The traditional way</b>: Click the <span class="btn">Receive</span> button on the account you wish 
                                to receive funds in, copy the <span class="btn">principal ID</span>, and share it with the sender. 
                                The sender then manually selects the token type, inputs this <span class="btn">principal ID</span> into 
                                the appropriate field, specifies the amount, and confirms the transaction. This method, while flexible 
                                (allowing funds from any wallet), requires careful input, thus increasing the risk of errors.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <b>The simplified way</b>: Click the <span class="btn">Receive</span> button on your account and copy 
                                the <span class="btn">MSQ payment link</span>. Share this link with the sender, who will be guided 
                                through an automated process that requires them to only enter the amount to send. This method 
                                significantly reduces the risk of mistakes, being user-friendly and straightforward. 
                                However, it is exclusive to MSQ wallet users and cannot be used with other wallets.

                                Yes, you can manage Ether (<span class="btn">ETH</span>) and Bitcoin (<span class="btn">BTC</span>) through MSQ, but with a unique approach. 
                                The Internet Computer uses an advanced Chain Key technology for token bridging, renowned for its 
                                high security. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Leveraging this technology, the Dfinity Foundation has introduced <span class="btn">ckETH</span> and <span class="btn">ckBTC</span> as bridged 
                                versions of Ether and Bitcoin, respectively. These are known as twin-tokens.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To use these in MSQ, first convert your ETH or BTC into ckETH or ckBTC via the <a target="_blank" href="https://nns.ic0.app">NNS Wallet</a> 
                                following their provided process. After conversion, you can manage these twin-tokens in MSQ 
                                like any <span class="btn">ICRC-1</span> token.
                            </p>

                                We are also developing a more straightforward method to deposit ETH directly into MSQ for MetaMask 
                                users, aiming to streamline the process.

                                Logging in with MSQ varies based on the website's integration with our system. For websites that 
                                support MSQ, you'll typically find a <span class="btn">Login with MetaMask</span> or <span class="btn">Login with MSQ</span> 
                                button. Clicking this button will redirect you to the MSQ website, where you'll be guided through the login process.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, if a website isn't integrated with MSQ, you won't be able to use MSQ for logging in. We are actively working 
                                on expanding our partnerships to increase the number of websites that support MSQ integration, enhancing accessibility for our users.

                                The ability to buy with MSQ depends on the website's integration. On websites that support MSQ, look for 
                                a <span class="btn">Pay with MetaMask</span> or <span class="btn">Pay with MSQ</span> button. Clicking this will 
                                take you to the MSQ website, which will guide you through the payment process.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If a website hasnâ€™t integrated with MSQ, unfortunately, you wonâ€™t be able to use MSQ there for payments. 
                                We are diligently working to expand our network and partner with more websites to enable broader 
                                integration and ease of payment with MSQ.

                                MSQ remains in Beta, aligning with MetaMask Snaps' current status. We'll 
                                transition out of Beta once the platform achieves stability. Additionally, our 
                                goal is to extend MSQ's functionality to mobile users before leaving Beta, which 
                                will significantly enhance its usability. Once this milestone is reached, we'll 
                                be in a strong position to stabilize the release. Until then, we advise against 
                                storing or transferring significant amounts of funds using MSQ.
